## Dependencies
Webpack (v2.3) is a bundler, which combines the various JavaScript, CSS, HTML (and other) files and makes them ready to be handled by the client.
Babel (v6.22) is a compiler for ECMAScript 6 to ECMAScript 5. These are different JavaScript standards and currently browsers are not able to understand all of ECMAScript 6 and so it needs to be converted.

## Testing Dependencies
Karma (v1.4) is a test runner, which spawns a web server with your project's application code inside and executes tests against it.
Mocha (v3.2) is a testing framework for JavaScript.
Chai (v3.5) is an assertion library which can be used with Mocha.
